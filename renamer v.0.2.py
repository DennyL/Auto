"""
    NOTE! Source is a folder that containes files to be renamed with addition of "(translation)" word.
    Dest is a folder that contains files, names of which are being taken for renaming files in a source folder.
    Files in both the folders share corresponding IDs, like:
    \dest\21. Ivan Ivanov.pdf and \source\21. Иван Иванов.docx.
    Here the first is an original file and the second is the translation of the first.
    An output of the script is to make a pair of those files with the same name,
    marking the one that contains a translation:
    So that "21. Иван Иванов.docx" became "21. Ivan Ivanov (translation).docx",
    keeping an original extension of the file.
    NOTE! For correct output of the script the files MUST have same IDs separated from the rest of a name by a dot.
